# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

If there is one thing Beks knows how to do, it is to jump headfirst into new, complicated technical material. After all, she got her start in the data analytic world by taking a 24-week bootcamp. It was no joke, but it taught her that with hard work she can accomplish anything. So, when Andy trusts her to develop a model that will accurately predict sound investments for the foundation, she jumps at the chance to explore neural networks as a potential solution.






Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
